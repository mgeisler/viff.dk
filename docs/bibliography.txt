The algorighms used by VIFF are published in various academic papers.
Here we will try to point out which parts of the code uses which
papers.

* ``viff/shamir.py``: Uses [Shamir79]_ extensively.

*  ``apps/millionaires.py``: Inspired by [Yao82]_.

* The default comparison operation (``Runtime.greater_than_equal``) is
  based on the comparison protocol from [Toft05]_.

* Broadcast (``Runtime.broadcast``) is based on the original paper by
  [Bracha84]_ and on the explanation by [Cachin05]_.
