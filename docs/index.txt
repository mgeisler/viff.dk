 VIFF Documentation
====================

Here you will find some resources about VIFF. Apart from these we
would also like to refer to the `API documentation`_ which not only
describes the API, but also tries to give a overview of the VIFF
architecture. The code examples includes in the ``apps/`` directory
also contains many hints on best practices with VIFF. Finally, the
unit tests in the ``viff/test/`` directory will show you many small
programs using all of VIFF.
