VIFF is a framework which allows you to specify secure multi-party
computations in a clean and easy way. Current features include:

* arithmetic with shares from |Zp| or |GF256|.

* secret sharing based on Shamir and pseudo-random secret sharing
  (PRSS).

* addition, multiplication, exclusive-or of shares.

* comparison of secret shared |Zp| inputs, with secret |Zp| or |GF256|
  output.

* automatic parallel (asynchronous) execution.

* secure communication using TLS (the successor to SSL).

* cute mascot :-)

VIFF is implemented in Python_ using Twisted_ and should run on any
platform where Python runs (succesfully tested on Linux and Windows).
Please see the INSTALL_ file for details on the requirements.

you can download and use it for free and modify it to suit your needs.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

VIFF allows you to do secure multi-party computations, in which a
number of parties (three or more at the moment) execute a
cryptographic protocol to do some joint computation. The computation
could be anything, but elections and auctions are good examples of
what you would want to do with secure multi-party computations (SMPC
or simply MPC if it is implied that the protocol is secure).

Using VIFF your protocol is run without the players revealing anything
about their inputs. So three millionaires can determine among
themselves who has, say, the most money *without revealing how much
they are worth* to one another. So they all learn who is richest, but
nothing else.

The techniques for doing this involves computations on secret shared
values, but the programmer can mostly ignore this when using VIFF.
Please see the example programs included in the distribution below.

Releases
~~~~~~~~

The latest version of the VIFF source code can be obtained using
Mercurial_ by the command::

  hg clone http://hg.viff.dk/viff/

or by `browsing the repository online`__. There you can also subscribe to
a RSS_ or Atom_ feed with updates.

.. _Atom: http://hg.viff.dk/viff/atom-log

The repository should be mostly stable and a snapshot can be
downloaded here:

You can also download a release below:

* **viff-0.3**: tar.bz2__, tar.gz__, zip__, released on December 27th 2007.

  Changes since 0.2: Secure communication between the players were
  implemented using TLS_ (the successor to SSL). An included Makefile
  can generate the needed certificates. The network layer was
  completely reimplemented, this breaks compatibility with programs
  written for VIFF version 0.2 or earlier.

  Changes since 0.1.1: Implemented overloaded arithmetic operators, so
  ``w = x + y * z`` now adds and multiplies the three shares as expected.
  Updated API documentation. Released using a Distutils setup.py
  script.

* **viff-0.1.1**: tar.bz2__, tar.gz__, zip__, released on October 23rd 2007.

  Changes since 0.1: Added API documentation and updated the
  installation instructions.

* **viff-0.1**: tar.bz2__, tar.gz__, zip__, released on October 16th 2007.

  .. __: http://viff.dk/release/viff-0.1.tar.bz2
  .. __: http://viff.dk/release/viff-0.1.tar.gz
  .. __: http://viff.dk/release/viff-0.1.zip

  First public release. Implements basic functionality including
  addition, multiplication, exclusive-or, and comparison of shares.
  Shares can be made using Shamir sharing or PRSS. Includes a suite of
  unit tests and example programs.

included in the files above.
