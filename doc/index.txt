 VIFF Documentation
====================

Here you will find some resources about VIFF.

API Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The API documentation not only describes the API, but also tries to
  give a overview of the VIFF architecture.

  .. note::

     The online API documentation reflects the current development
     version of VIFF. You might therefore prefer the API documentation
     bundled with each release.

  Available `online`__.

* The code examples includes in the ``apps/`` directory also contains
  many hints on best practices with VIFF. The ``apps/millionaires.py``
  example is particularly well commented and may serve as a template
  for new programs.

* The unit tests in the ``viff/test/`` directory will show you many
  small programs using all of VIFF.
